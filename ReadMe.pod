=head1 DESCRIPTION

TestML is a programming language agnostic, data driven testing language. It is
a descendent of Perl's Test::Base, made to work in any programming language.

Some projects only need a subset of TestML, and would like it to be in a
single file that ships with their project. TestML::Tiny aims to be that.

=head1 HOW TO TESTML

TestML is really clean and simple in practice, but it involves learning a few
new concepts. There's TestML code and data sections, bridge classes, and
runner files.

The best start is to see it in practice. eq Look through a test suite like the
one in here.

=head1 STATUS

This 0.0.3 version is not fully functional yet. Only the data section
parser works.

This version is being used in YAML::Tiny development.
