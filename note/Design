=head1 Design Notes

== Files involved

- t/testml_foo.t            - Perl test file
- t/lib/TestML/Tiny.pm      - TestML::Tiny runtime
- t/lib/TestBridge.pm       - TestML/Perl bridge class
- t/testml/foo.tml          - TestML file. No Perl.

- Perl, bridge and TestML text all go in the .t file:
  - Bridge-class defaults to 'main'
  - TestML file defaults to DATA
- Ideally, only data conversion code goes in a bridge class. No Test::More
  stuff is called directly.
